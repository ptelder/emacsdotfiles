* First stab at a synced org-mode setup

*Now testing under 25.1.50.1!*

I first touched Emacs sometime in the mid-90's and bounded right off the weirdness of it's interface.

More recently I got into the idea of doing [[http://nanowrimo.org/][NaNoWriMo]], and found myself in need of an industrial strength text-processing solution. I'd tried Emacs again to get in on some of that org-mode goodness, but hadn't stuck with it.

Part of the problem was that I'd find time to get Emacs setup, and then forget how I'd done it, reinstall my system, and be back at square one.

Then I found [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIuOwIBL-ZU][Daniel Mai's video]], and I started putting this together to get Emacs setup on all my systems consistently, one and for all (at least until 25 comes out...)

Feel free to copy, but be warned...

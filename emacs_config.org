#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Kenneth W Brown III

This concept is blatantly ripped off from Daniel Mai. This file assumes Emacs 24 or above.

* Personal Information

I have no idea where this gets used, but the Emacs docs say they're legit... Perhaps they can be fed to default skeletons?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Kenneth W Brown III"
      user-mail-address "pliny@ptelder.net")
#+end_src

* Customize settings

Set up the customize file to its own separate file, instead of saving
customize settings in [[file:init.el][init.el]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq custom-file (expand-file-name "customize-persistence.el" user-emacs-directory))
(load custom-file)
#+end_src

* Themes
** Daniel Mai's theme switch functions

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun switch-theme (theme)
  "Disables any currently active themes and loads THEME."
  ;; This interactive call is taken from `load-theme'
  (interactive
   (list
    (intern (completing-read "Load custom theme: "
                             (mapc 'symbol-name
                                   (custom-available-themes))))))
  (let ((enabled-themes custom-enabled-themes))
    (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)
    (load-theme theme t)))

(defun disable-active-themes ()
  "Disables any currently active themes listed in `custom-enabled-themes'."
  (interactive)
  (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes))

(bind-key "s-<f12>" 'switch-theme)
(bind-key "s-<f11>" 'disable-active-themes)
#+end_src


** Personal Theme Setup
*** Birds of Paradise

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package birds-of-paradise-plus-theme
  :ensure t
  :init
  (progn
    (load-theme 'birds-of-paradise-plus t)))
#+end_src

* Temporary Smex Settings
I need to decide if I'm using Ido or Helm before doing anything else with this bit

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'smex) ; Not needed if you use package.el
(smex-initialize) ; Can be omitted. This might cause a (minimal) delay
                  ; when Smex is auto-initialized on its first run.

(global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'smex)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-X") 'smex-major-mode-commands)
;; This is your old M-x.
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c M-x") 'execute-extended-command)

#+end_src
